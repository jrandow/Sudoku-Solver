Welcome to my GUI Sudoku Solver!

You need to have both python files (GUI.py and sudokusolver_GUI.py) in the same folder.
GUI.py contains all the graphical interface which pops up when running the program including text labels and buttons.
sudokusolver_GUI.py is "the brain" and contains the methods to solve the Sudoku.

--> To use the software run GUI.py
You can either type in a not-yet-solved Sudoku by hand or load in one from a file.
Note: Loading in is quite fragile right now. Basically it reads in a file and reads the first 81 digits in it, while empty spaces must be denoted as 0.
Please don't try to crack this method - you'll probably manage quite easy to do so. You can take "read.txt" as an example, that works.

Best
